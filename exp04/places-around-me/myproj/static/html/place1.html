Shree Niketan realizes the importance of the holistic development of the students. Emphasis is laid on shaping students into smart individuals with strong commitment to their chosen goals. Individual sports like, Archery, Skating, Tennis are a part of physical education for all age groups, aimed at grooming the students on self-confidence, fitness and skill sets under the expert guidance of the professional trainers.
The School has plans to build synthetic Tennis Courts for students eager to train in this elite sport. Quality training is also provided in athletics, track and field events in the vast playground of the school. Similarly, a skating rink is to be designed for students to train in roller-skating. Shree Niketan does not miss a chance to make schooling for the students memorable in their lifetime.
At Shree Niketan, students are taught to love and respect nature. Tree planting, rainwater harvesting, organic farming and so on are not only taught but students are encouraged to implement these activities in their neighbourhood.
Shree Niketan practices what it preaches. Students are also taken to nearby hamlets as a part of community service. Patriotism is also inculcated in the students of the school by providing NCC training that forms the fourth line of defense. Inculcating such habits right from the impressionable age help them grow with an understanding of their role and responsibility towards the society they live in.
